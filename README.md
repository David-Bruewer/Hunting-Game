# Hunting-Game
A game about hunting and dilemmas and such

# About 
This game is about hunting. Currently there are two modes, single-player and multiplayer. 
In single player mode, the player must hunt moles to stay alive, the more moles they can hunt, the longer they can stay alive. 
In multiplayer mode, players compete battle-royale style in hunting moles to see who can live the longest. 
Future Updates will add more depth and different animals to the game. 
Have fun!
